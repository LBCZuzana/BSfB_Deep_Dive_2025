    "### Key Findings\n",
    "- **CSSW involvement** strongly correlated with **agencies involved**, reflecting the clustering of statutory service support.  \n",
    "- **Parental mental health** correlated with **other barriers** and modestly with **CSSW involvement**, underlining the overlap between mental health challenges and wider social difficulties.  \n",
    "- **Physical health needs (child)** correlated with **parent physical health needs**, suggesting clustering of health vulnerabilities within families.  \n",
    "- **NICU/NNU experience** showed little overlap with other variables — more of an isolated barrier.  \n",
    "- **Maternal first language** showed weak correlations with other barriers, meaning language needs are relatively distinct.  \n",

    "### Implications\n",
    "- Families involved with statutory or multiple agencies often experience **clusters of overlapping barriers**.  \n",
    "- Some barriers (e.g., language, NICU experience) are more **standalone** but still require targeted support.  \n",
    "- Interventions should account for both types: **multi-barrier families** needing holistic support, and **single-barrier families** needing tailored solutions.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This deep dive analysis highlights several important themes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Engagement with Family Help** is the single strongest driver of positive outcomes.  \n",
    "2. **Socioeconomic disadvantage** (deprivation, unemployment, lone parenting, large families) consistently reduces attendance.  \n",
    "3. **Barriers cluster** in families with statutory service involvement, particularly around mental health and social support needs.  \n",
    "4. **Isolated barriers** (like language or NICU experience) still present risks but require different strategies than clustered barriers.  \n",
    "5. For families with known barriers, following a booking, **an ongoing engagement and tailored support are to be considered**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Insights\n",
    "- Outcomes are shaped by the **interaction between engagement and structural disadvantage**.  \n",
    "- Families with multiple pressures (deprivation, unemployment, single parenting, many children) are at highest risk of disengagement.  \n",
    "- Culturally and logistically tailored strategies can help address both clustered and standalone barriers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Build a **predictive model** that combines these variables to flag families at risk of non-attendance or decline.  \n",
    "- Develop **targeted engagement strategies** for deprived areas, larger families, families living further away from the centre, and single-parent households.  \n",
    "- Gather **qualitative insights** from families to understand lived experiences behind the patterns observed.  "
